Hi everyone. My name is Yang Li(李旸 in Chinese). I am now a PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. My research interest now is LLM security.

Prior to Tsinghua, I received my bachelor's degree in Intelligence Science and Technology in Central South University in 2017, and master's degree in Computer Science and Technology in Xi'an JiaoTong University in 2020. In XJTU, I used to work on graph mining tasks including community detection and graph neural networks. During 2020-2023, I worked in Bank of Beijing as a project manager.

_Feel free to contact me via email, although I might not respond._
